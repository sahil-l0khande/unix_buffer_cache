/*
 * Each buffer in the pool is usually doubly linked into 2 lists:
 * the device with which it is currently associated (always)
 * and also on a list of blocks available for allocation
 * for other use (usually).
 * The latter list is kept in last-used order, and the two
 * lists are doubly linked to make it easy to remove
 * a buffer from one list when it was found by
 * looking through the other.
 * A buffer is on the available list, and is liable
 * to be reassigned to another disk block, if and only
 * if it is not marked BUSY.  When a buffer is busy, the
 * available-list pointers can be used for other purposes.
 * Most drivers use the forward ptr as a link in their I/O
 * active queue.
 * A buffer header contains all the information required
 * to perform I/O.
 * Most of the routines which manipulate these things
 * are in bio.c.
